Seoul introduced Ddareungi to increase the mobility comfort and for eco-environment policy in order to make the rental bike available to the public at the right time.

These are based on the Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) with the corresponding weather data and holiday information. This will help Seoul to have a stable supply of rental bikes to the public.
